Stock Market Predictor using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a  Q Learning Agent for stock trading. Q-Learning Algorithm is a reinforcement Learning Algorithm in which an agent picks up new information by observing results, interacting with the environment, and getting feedback in the form of rewards.

The agent can perform three actions - buy, sell and hold. 
The rewards are based on the profit made from buying and selling. 
 The agent stores its experiences and uses them to train the model in batches, improving learning efficiency.
